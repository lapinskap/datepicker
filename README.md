# vue datepicker

Vue.js datepicker, I didn't add any other library.

Components are based on documentation of another datepicker solutions, especially the navigation stuff. 

(I also added a lot of props here, not sure how to simplify the code yet)

**Disabled functions are still in progress, there are errors**
